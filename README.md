# PseudoPotentialIO.jl

PseudoPotentialIO aims to provide parsers for common pseudopotential file formats used by density functional theory codes and an interface for accesssing the quantities that they contain.

Currently, Unified Pseudopotential Format (UPF) and Abinit pseudopotential format version 8 (psp8) parsers have been at least partially implemented.
